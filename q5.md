#Approach 1
The function doubleL(n) is defined that takes an integer 'n'. Then, it creates an empty list 'res'. The function then iterates through the values from 0 to n-1 (0 to 4 in this case), multiplying each number by 2, and appends the result to the list 'res'. Finally, it returns the list 'res'. The for loop outside of the function iterates over the elements of the returned list, 'res', and prints each element followed by a colon by using the end parameter. 

#Approach 2 
This function uses list comprehension to create a list '[n * 2 for n in range (5)]'
This list comprehension iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to n-1 (0 to 4 in this case), then multiplies each of the numbers by 2. The results are collected in a list. Then the returned array of values is iterated through the values is printed and uses the end parameter to add a colon.

#Approach 3
A generator function doubleG(n) is defined. This function takes an integer n as input, and iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to n-1 (0 to 4 in this case). Each number is multiplied by 2 and yields the result. In other words, the state of the function is frozen and the function's local variables are remembered between successive calls. The field following 'yield' keyword is returned to the caller. Then the generator function and the execution resumes from where it was suspended, allowing the function to produce values one at a time without storing the entire sequence in memory. The for loop outside of the function is used to iterate through the returned values from doubleG(n) and print each element followed by a colon. This approach generates the values one at a time without storing all the values at once, so for large values of 'n' this can save memory.
